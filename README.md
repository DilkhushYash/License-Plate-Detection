🔍 License Plate Detection using YOLOv8 and OCR

This project aims to detect license plates from vehicle images using a YOLOv8 deep learning model and extract the text from the plates using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It was submitted to the IEEE Info Pixel competition and secured 3rd rank 🥉.

📌 Project Highlights
🧠 YOLOv8 trained on a labeled Kaggle dataset for license plate detection

🔍 Detection Accuracy: 86.26%

🎯 Precision: 82.96%

✂️ Cropping detected license plates from vehicle images

📝 OCR to extract alphanumeric text from license plates
